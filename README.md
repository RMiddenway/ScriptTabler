# ScriptTabler
 
Python prototype for a utility that uses an expert rules system to convert pdf screenply style scripts into tables for use in dubbing.

In order to dub a film or TV show into another language, the script undergoes several transformations. Usually, a producer or assistant will go through the screenplay style script of the program, and convert it into tables containing only the dialogue. This is a slow and repetitive process which i set out to automate.

# Current issues:

Script document type and formatting can vary, this script is only designed to handle pdf files in the traditional format.

# Future plans:

Use supervised learning to implement a machine learning approach.
Add support for various document types.
Create a ScriptTimecoder process which uses voice recognition and machine learning to fill the approximate timecodes for each line.
